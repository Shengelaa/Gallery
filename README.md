This project is an image gallery that allows users to view images,
filter them by category (such as cats, dogs, hamsters),
and search for images based on their titles. The images are fetched from a data.json file,
and the functionality includes dynamic rendering of images, filtering by category, and searching by title.
Additionally, clicking on an image opens a modal to view the image in a larger size.
